# MLHC_finalProject2023
This repository contains the final project of MLHC2023 course made by Gal Bodek and Keren Danan.
In this project we aimed to predict mortality and classify sepsis patients enrolled in the PROVIDE clinical trial using both clinical data and 
Olink proteomics data. 

This repository contains multiple files: 

1- Preprocessing.ipynb 

2- Model.ipynb

3- Data directory: contains the raw data. 

4- Data Analysis directory: contains data exploratory plots about the distribution of the data and KM survival analysis of the clinial data only and missing rates plots.

5- Evaluation directory: contains basic metric plots of the mortality prediction models, SHAP values of RF model and features importance of RF MDI. 

6- Feature Selection for Classification directory: contains Cox proportional hazards regression survival analysis divided to clinical features results and Olink features results 

7- Endotypes directory: contains plots regarding the second classification model
